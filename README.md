# Using Common Widgets
In this chapter, I learned about the basic tools needed to create mobile apps. I looked at different kinds of buttons to choose the best one for each situation. I figured out how to add images and other items to my app by listing them in the pubspec.yaml file using AssetBundle. The Image widget let me show pictures from my device or from a website using a URL. I also discovered that the Icon widget helps me show icons using the MaterialIcons library.

To change how the widgets look, I explored BoxDecoration. I made it easier for users to get feedback on what they entered by using InputDecoration. While checking several text fields can be hard, the Form widget helps with both checking them by hand and automatically. Lastly, I understood how helpful MediaQuery is for finding out the device's orientation, which is important for arranging widgets properly based on that orientation.
